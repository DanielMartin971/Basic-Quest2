# Basic-Quest2

## Description
This is a game I was working on several years ago that was using ES5 and I wanted to change it all up and swap it over to ES6 and give myself some more training with Javscript. This was the intentions on the first iteration of the game and it allowed me to learn a lot. This game is called Basic Quest! It is a RPG game with a inventory system, weapons types, abilities, bosses, stats! The whole of a RPG. There's a shop to go to, to get different weapons, you have a healing system that can only be refilled in the shop. It can be challenging later on from the more bosses you slay and might get you killed if you heal at the wrong moment. Welcome to... Basic Quest 2.

## Usage
Its a clicking game, the way to start is by choosing a character, seeing what they start with and hitting that select button! From then on, you'll be put into the game asking if you want to start! You then go on clicking the buttons of either defending, attacking or using magic!
